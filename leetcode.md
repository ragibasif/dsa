# LeetCode

## Code Templates

### Two pointers: one input, opposite ends 

```py
def fn(arr):
    left = ans = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1

    while left < right:
        # do some logic here with left and right
        if CONDITION:
            left += 1
        else:
            right -= 1
    
    return ans
```

### Two pointers: two inputs, exhaust both

```py
def fn(arr1, arr2):
    i = j = ans = 0

    while i < len(arr1) and j < len(arr2):
        # do some logic here
        if CONDITION:
            i += 1
        else:
            j += 1
    
    while i < len(arr1):
        # do logic
        i += 1
    
    while j < len(arr2):
        # do logic
        j += 1
    
    return ans
```

### Sliding window

```py
def fn(arr):
    left = ans = curr = 0

    for right in range(len(arr)):
        # do logic here to add arr[right] to curr

        while WINDOW_CONDITION_BROKEN:
            # remove arr[left] from curr
            left += 1

        # update ans
    
    return ans
```

### Build a prefix sum

```py
def fn(arr):
    prefix = [arr[0]]
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        prefix.append(prefix[-1] + arr[i])
    
    return prefix
```

### Efficient string building

```py
# arr is a list of characters
def fn(arr):
    ans = []
    for c in arr:
        ans.append(c)
    
    return "".join(ans)
```

### Linked list: fast and slow pointer

```py
def fn(head):
    slow = head
    fast = head
    ans = 0

    while fast and fast.next:
        # do logic
        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next.next
    
    return ans
```

### Reversing a linked list

```py
def fn(head):
    curr = head
    prev = None
    while curr:
        next_node = curr.next
        curr.next = prev
        prev = curr
        curr = next_node 
        
    return prev
```

### Find number of subarrays that fit an exact criteria

```py
from collections import defaultdict

def fn(arr, k):
    counts = defaultdict(int)
    counts[0] = 1
    ans = curr = 0

    for num in arr:
        # do logic to change curr
        ans += counts[curr - k]
        counts[curr] += 1
    
    return ans
```

### Monotonic increasing stack

The same logic can be applied to maintain a monotonic queue.

```py
def fn(arr):
    stack = []
    ans = 0

    for num in arr:
        # for monotonic decreasing, just flip the > to <
        while stack and stack[-1] > num:
            # do logic
            stack.pop()
        stack.append(num)
    
    return ans
```

### Binary tree: DFS (recursive)

```py
def dfs(root):
    if not root:
        return
    
    ans = 0

    # do logic
    dfs(root.left)
    dfs(root.right)
    return ans
```

### Binary tree: DFS (iterative)

```py
def dfs(root):
    stack = [root]
    ans = 0

    while stack:
        node = stack.pop()
        # do logic
        if node.left:
            stack.append(node.left)
        if node.right:
            stack.append(node.right)

    return ans
```

### Binary tree: BFS 

```py
from collections import deque

def fn(root):
    queue = deque([root])
    ans = 0

    while queue:
        current_length = len(queue)
        # do logic for current level

        for _ in range(current_length):
            node = queue.popleft()
            # do logic
            if node.left:
                queue.append(node.left)
            if node.right:
                queue.append(node.right)

    return ans
```

### Graph: DFS (recursive)

For the graph templates, assume the nodes are numbered from 0 to n - 1 and the graph is given as an adjacency list. Depending on the problem, you may need to convert the input into an equivalent adjacency list before using the templates.

```py
def fn(graph):
    def dfs(node):
        ans = 0
        # do some logic
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            if neighbor not in seen:
                seen.add(neighbor)
                ans += dfs(neighbor)
        
        return ans

    seen = {START_NODE}
    return dfs(START_NODE)
```

### Graph: DFS (iterative)

```py
def fn(graph):
    stack = [START_NODE]
    seen = {START_NODE}
    ans = 0

    while stack:
        node = stack.pop()
        # do some logic
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            if neighbor not in seen:
                seen.add(neighbor)
                stack.append(neighbor)
    
    return ans
```

### Graph: BFS

```py
from collections import deque

def fn(graph):
    queue = deque([START_NODE])
    seen = {START_NODE}
    ans = 0

    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        # do some logic
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            if neighbor not in seen:
                seen.add(neighbor)
                queue.append(neighbor)
    
    return ans
```

### Find top k elements with heap

```py
import heapq

def fn(arr, k):
    heap = []
    for num in arr:
        # do some logic to push onto heap according to problem's criteria
        heapq.heappush(heap, (CRITERIA, num))
        if len(heap) > k:
            heapq.heappop(heap)
    
    return [num for num in heap]
```

### Binary search 

```py
def fn(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            # do something
            return
        if arr[mid] > target:
            right = mid - 1
        else:
            left = mid + 1
    
    # left is the insertion point
    return left
```

### Binary search: duplicate elements, left-most insertion point

```py
def fn(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr)
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] >= target:
            right = mid
        else:
            left = mid + 1

    return left
```

### Binary search: duplicate elements, right-most insertion point

```py
def fn(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr)
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] > target:
            right = mid
        else:
            left = mid + 1

    return left
```

### Binary search: for greedy problems

If looking for a minimum:

```py
def fn(arr):
    def check(x):
        # this function is implemented depending on the problem
        return BOOLEAN

    left = MINIMUM_POSSIBLE_ANSWER
    right = MAXIMUM_POSSIBLE_ANSWER
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if check(mid):
            right = mid - 1
        else:
            left = mid + 1
    
    return left
```

If looking for a maximum:

```py
def fn(arr):
    def check(x):
        # this function is implemented depending on the problem
        return BOOLEAN

    left = MINIMUM_POSSIBLE_ANSWER
    right = MAXIMUM_POSSIBLE_ANSWER
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if check(mid):
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    
    return right
```

### Backtracking

```py
def backtrack(curr, OTHER_ARGUMENTS...):
    if (BASE_CASE):
        # modify the answer
        return
    
    ans = 0
    for (ITERATE_OVER_INPUT):
        # modify the current state
        ans += backtrack(curr, OTHER_ARGUMENTS...)
        # undo the modification of the current state
    
    return ans
```

### Dynamic programming: top-down memoization

```py
def fn(arr):
    def dp(STATE):
        if BASE_CASE:
            return 0
        
        if STATE in memo:
            return memo[STATE]
        
        ans = RECURRENCE_RELATION(STATE)
        memo[STATE] = ans
        return ans

    memo = {}
    return dp(STATE_FOR_WHOLE_INPUT)
```


To convert a top-down solution to a bottom-up one:

1. Initialize an array `dp` that is sized according to the state variables. For example, let's say the input to the problem was an array `nums` and an integer `k` that represents the maximum number of actions allowed. Your array `dp` would be 2D with one dimension of length `nums.length` and the other of length `k`. In the top-down approach, we had a function `dp`. We want these two to be equivalent. For example, the value of `dp(4, 6)` can now be found in `dp[4][6]`.

2. Set your base cases, same as the ones you are using in your top-down function. In the example we just looked at, we had `dp(0)` = `dp(1)` = `0`. We can initialize our `dp` array values to 0 to implicitly set this base case. As you'll see soon, other problems will have more complicated base cases.

3. Write a for-loop(s) that iterate over your state variables. If you have multiple state variables, you will need nested for-loops. These loops should **start iterating from the base cases and end at the answer state**.

4. Now, each iteration of the inner-most loop represents a given state, and is equivalent to a function call to the same state in top-down. Copy-paste the logic from your function into the for-loop and change the function calls to accessing your array. All `dp(...)` changes into `dp[...]`.

5. We're done! `dp` is now an array populated with the answer to the original problem for all possible states. Return the answer to the original problem, by changing `return dp(...)` to `return dp[...]`.



```py
def fn(arr, k):
    # 1. Initialize dp array (sized to state variables)
    # Using 'n' and 'k' as example dimensions
    n = len(arr)
    dp = [[0] * (k + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]

    # 2. Set base cases (if not already handled by initialization)
    # Example: dp[0][j] = some_value 

    # 3. Iterate over state variables
    # Start from base cases and move toward the target state
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(1, k + 1):
            
            # 4. Copy-paste recurrence logic
            # Change dp(state) function calls to dp[state] lookups
            dp[i][j] = RECURRENCE_RELATION_LOGIC
            
    # 5. Return the final state
    return dp[n][k]
```

Changes made:

- Storage: Replaced the `memo` dictionary with a pre-allocated 2D array `dp`.
- Direction: Replaced recursion with nested `for` loops that build the solution from the "bottom" (simplest cases) "up" (final answer).
- Access: Instead of calling `dp(i, j)`, you now access `dp[i][j]`.

### Build a trie

```py
# note: using a class is only necessary if you want to store data at each node.
# otherwise, you can implement a trie using only hash maps.
class TrieNode:
    def __init__(self):
        # you can store data at nodes if you wish
        self.data = None
        self.children = {}

def fn(words):
    root = TrieNode()
    for word in words:
        curr = root
        for c in word:
            if c not in curr.children:
                curr.children[c] = TrieNode()
            curr = curr.children[c]
        # at this point, you have a full word at curr
        # you can perform more logic here to give curr an attribute if you want
    
    return root
```

### Dijkstra's algorithm

```py
from math import inf
from heapq import *

distances = [inf] * n
distances[source] = 0
heap = [(0, source)]

while heap:
    curr_dist, node = heappop(heap)
    if curr_dist > distances[node]:
        continue
    
    for nei, weight in graph[node]:
        dist = curr_dist + weight
        if dist < distances[nei]:
            distances[nei] = dist
            heappush(heap, (dist, nei))
```
